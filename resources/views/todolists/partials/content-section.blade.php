    <h2 class="text-regular font-medium">Why We Built This Todo List (And Why You'll Actually Want to Use It)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Look, I've tried them all. Todoist's free version barely lets you organize anything. Any.do looks pretty but good luck getting reminders without paying. Don't even get me started on how Wunderlist disappeared and Microsoft To Do still feels like a downgrade.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The problem with most "free" todo apps? They give you just enough to get hooked, then hit you with a paywall the moment you need something useful. Want email reminders? That'll be $5 a month. Need to color-code your tasks? Premium feature. Multiple lists? Sorry, free users get one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That's exactly why we made this. A todo list that actually works without constantly asking for your credit card.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="text-regular font-medium">What You Get (No Strings Attached)</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Multiple Lists & Organization</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Create separate lists for work, personal, shopping, or whatever chaos you're managing. Most free apps limit you to one list or a handful of tasks.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Priority Colors That Actually Help</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Red for urgent, yellow for important, green for whenever-you-get-to-it. Visual priority sorting that doesn't require a subscription.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Real Email Notifications</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Here's the big one - you get actual email alerts when deadlines approach or pass. Not just phone notifications you'll ignore, but emails that land in your inbox. Most apps either don't offer this for free users or send you promotional emails disguised as "notifications."</p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="text-black">Smart Filtering</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Click to see only high-priority items, or filter by what's due today. Basic functionality that somehow became a premium feature elsewhere.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Deadline Management</h3>
    <p>Set due dates and times without hitting upgrade walls. Revolutionary concept, right?</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-regular font-medium">Questions People Actually Ask</h2><br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Do you really send email notifications for free?</h3><br>
    <p>Yes. Real deadline alerts to your actual email address. No upgrade required, no limited number of notifications, no catch. This seems to shock people because apparently basic functionality is now considered premium.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">How many lists can I create?</h3><br>
    <p>As many as you want. We don't artificially limit this to push you toward paid plans.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Can I share lists with other people?</h3><br>
    <p>Not yet, but it's coming. Unlike other apps, when we add sharing, it'll be free too.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Will this stay free or become another bait-and-switch?</h3><br>
    <p>The core features stay free. We're not trying to build a subscription empire here - just a todo list that works like todo lists should work.</p><br>

    <h3 class="text-black">What about mobile apps?</h3><br>
    <p>Works great in your phone's browser. We know everyone wants native apps, but honestly, the web version does everything you need without taking up storage space.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-black">Do you sell my data or send spam?</h3><br>
    <p>No data selling. The only emails you'll get are the deadline notifications you asked for. We're not trying to become your new newsletter subscription.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-regular font-medium">The Bottom Line</h2><br>
    <p>This exists because we got tired of todo apps that treat basic organization features like luxury add-ons. Email notifications shouldn't cost $60 a year. Color-coding tasks shouldn't require a premium subscription.</p><br>
    <p>If you've bounced between Todoist, Any.do, Microsoft To Do, and TickTick looking for something that just works without the constant upgrade prompts, this might be what you've been looking for.</p><br>
    <p>Free means free. Working means working. Email notifications included.</p><br>
